This file is here only to ensure its parent XPF directory gets created when the repo is cloned. Without that directory in place, the post-build copy events fail for the projects RedBadger.Xpf.Phone and RedBadger.Xpf.Phone.Adapters.Xna, yielding very poor feedback from Visual Studio. (It creates dummy “XPF” file is created where the directory should be, and the copy commands fail with a code of 1.)
